            <setDescription>The scores and libretti in this Virtual Collection include first and
                early editions and manuscript copies of music from the eighteenth and early
                nineteenth centuries by J.S. Bach and Bach family members, Mozart, Schubert and
                other composers, as well as multiple versions of nineteenth century opera scores,
                seminal works of musical modernism, and music of the Second Viennese School. Many,
                such as variant editions of nineteenth century operas and related libretti, fall
                into intellectually related sets that are meant to be seen and used together. </setDescription>
